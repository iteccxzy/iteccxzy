- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel, I live in Corrientes Argentina. I have a degree in computer science and a little over 2 years ago I began to dedicate myself to web development initially with Python and Django, then also with frameworks such as Vuejs. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in development opportunities mainly with Django and Python. My search is focused on trying to join a team where I can contribute my experience, learnings to be able to have the feedback that complements my skills.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science with Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib in notebook environments.
